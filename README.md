# NAME

Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::Methods - Add enumerated methods for HTTP requests

# VERSION

version v0.4.0

# SYNOPSIS

In the [Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) class

```perl
__PACKAGE__->config(
  request_class_traits => [
      'Methods'
  ]
);
```

In any code that uses a [Catalyst::Request](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst%3A%3ARequest), e.g.

```
if ($c->request->is_post) {
    ...
}
```

# DESCRIPTION

This trait adds enumerated methods from RFC 7231 and RFC 5789 for
checking the HTTP request method.

Using these methods is a less error-prone alternative to checking a
case-sensitive string with the method name.

In other words, you can use

```
$c->request->is_get
```

instead of

```
$c->request->method eq "GET"
```

The methods are implemented as lazy read-only attributes.

# METHODS

## is\_get

The request method is `GET`.

## is\_head

The request method is `HEAD`.

## is\_post

The request method is `POST`.

## is\_put

The request method is `PUT`.

## is\_delete

The request method is `DELETE`.

## is\_connect

The request method is `CONNECT`.

## is\_options

The request method is `OPTIONS`.

## is\_trace

The request method is `TRACE`.

## is\_patch

The request method is `PATCH`.

## is\_propfind

The request method is `PROPFIND`.

## is\_unrecognized\_method

The request method is not recognized.
